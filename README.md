### Machine Learning Approach to Quadcopter Control

Quadcopter control using machine learning can be framed as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where the goal is to learn an optimal policy that maximizes long-term rewards. This approach leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to approximate solutions to the Bellman optimality equations, providing a robust mechanism for decision-making in dynamic and complex environments. 

#### Modeling the Control Problem as a Markov Decision Process

In reinforcement learning, the control problem is modeled as a finite Markov Decision Process (MDP) defined by:
- A set of states $\mathcal{S}$.
- A set of actions $\mathcal{A}$.
- A reward function $\mathcal{R}$.
- State transition probabilities $p(s',r|s,a)$, which give the probability of moving to state $s'$ and receiving reward $r$, given the current state $s$ and action $a$:

$$
p(s',r|s,a) = \text{Pr}\{S_t=s', R_t=r | S_{t-1}=s, A_{t-1}=a\}
$$

The MDP's dynamics are entirely captured by this probability function $p$.

#### Returns and Episodes

The objective in RL is to maximize the expected return, which is a function of the sequence of rewards. The simplest form of return is the sum of rewards over time:

$$
G_t = R_{t+1} + R_{t+2} + R_{t+3} + \cdots + R_T
$$

However, a more common approach is to use a discounted return, which applies a discount factor $\gamma \in [0,1]$ to future rewards, making them progressively less valuable:

$$
G_t = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^k R_{t+k+1}
$$

#### Policies and Value Functions

A policy $\pi$ represents the agent's strategy, mapping states to a probability distribution over actions. The value function $v_\pi(s)$ quantifies the expected return when starting from state $s$ and following policy $\pi$:

$$
v_\pi(s) = \mathbb{E}_\pi[G_t | S_t = s] = \mathbb{E}_\pi \left[\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^k R_{t+k+1} \middle| S_t = s\right]
$$

Similarly, the action-value function $q_\pi(s,a)$ represents the expected return from state $s$, taking action $a$, and then following policy $\pi$:

$$
q_\pi(s,a) = \mathbb{E}_\pi[G_t | S_t = s, A_t = a]
$$

#### The Bellman Equation

The Bellman equation provides a recursive decomposition of the value function, expressing the value of a state as the expected immediate reward plus the discounted value of successor states:

$$
v_\pi(s) = \sum_a \pi(a|s) \sum_{s',r} p(s', r | s, a) [r + \gamma v_\pi(s')]
$$

This equation is fundamental in determining the value function for any given policy.

#### Optimal Policies and Value Functions

The goal of solving an RL task is to find an optimal policy $\pi_*$ that maximizes the expected return across all states. The optimal state-value function $v_*$ and action-value function $q_*$ are defined as:

$$
v_*(s) = \max_\pi v_\pi(s)
$$

$$
q_*(s,a) = \max_\pi q_\pi(s,a)
$$

The optimal action-value function $q_*$ can be further expressed in terms of the optimal state-value function $v_*$:

$$
q_*(s,a) = \mathbb{E}[R_{t+1} + \gamma v_*(S_{t+1}) | S_t=s, A_t=a]
$$

The Bellman optimality equations for $v_*$ and $q_*$ provide the foundation for finding these optimal functions:

$$
v_*(s) = \max_{a} \sum_{s',r} p(s', r|s,a)[r + \gamma v_*(s')]
$$

$$
q_*(s,a) = \sum_{s',r} p(s', r|s,a)[r + \gamma \max_{a'} q_*(s', a')]
$$

These equations describe the self-consistency condition that must be satisfied for the value functions under an optimal policy.

#### The Advantage Function

The advantage function $A_t$ quantifies the relative value of taking a specific action $a$ in state $s$ over the average action, defined as:
$$
A_t = q_\pi(s, a) - v_\pi(s)
$$
where $q_\pi(s, a)$ is the expected return for taking action $a$ in state $s$ and $v_\pi(s)$ is the average expected return from state $s$.

#### Solving the MDP with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a practical reinforcement learning algorithm that approximates the solution to the Bellman optimality equations. PPO operates by iteratively improving a parameterized policy $\pi_\theta(a|s)$ and value function $V_\phi(s)$, both of which are typically represented using neural networks.

The core idea of PPO is to maximize a clipped surrogate objective function:

$$
L(\theta) = \mathbb{E}\left[\min(r_t(\theta)A_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon)A_t)\right]
$$

where

$$
r_t(\theta) = \frac{\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_\text{old}}(a_t|s_t)}
$$

and $A_t$ is an estimate of the advantage function. This objective allows for substantial policy updates while constraining them to avoid instability.

PPO indirectly approximates the Bellman optimality equation:

$$
v^*(s) = \max_a \mathbb{E}[R_{t+1} + \gamma v^*(S_{t+1}) | S_t=s, A_t=a]
$$

PPO leverages sampled trajectories from the environment to update the policy and value function, circumventing the need for exact knowledge of environment dynamics. This makes PPO particularly suitable for high-dimensional and continuous state and action spaces where traditional methods fail.

#### Algorithm Implementation

The PPO algorithm iteratively collects trajectories, computes advantages and returns, and updates the policy and value networks to converge towards an optimal policy:

```python
def collect_trajectory(env, policy_network, max_timesteps=1000):
    states = []
    actions = []
    rewards = []
    log_probs = []
    
    state = env.reset()  # Start a new episode
    for t in range(max_timesteps):
        # Get action probabilities from policy network
        action_probs = policy_network(state)
        
        # Sample an action
        action = sample_action(action_probs)
        
        # Take the action in the environment
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        
        # Store the experience
        states.append(state)
        actions.append(action)
        rewards.append(reward)
        log_probs.append(log(action_probs[action]))  # Log probability of the chosen action
        
        # Move to the next state
        state = next_state
        
        # If the episode is done (e.g., quadcopter crashed), we can end early
        if done:
            break
    
    return states, actions, rewards, log_probs

def PPO(env, num_episodes, num_epochs, batch_size):
    # Initialize policy network π_θ and value network V_φ
    policy_network = initialize_policy_network()
    value_network = initialize_value_network()
    
    for episode in range(num_episodes):
        # Collect trajectory data
        states, actions, rewards, log_probs_old = collect_trajectory(env, policy_network)
        
        # Compute advantages and returns
        advantages = compute_advantages(rewards, value_network)
        returns = compute_returns(rewards)
        
        for epoch in range(num_epochs):
            # Sample mini-batches
            for batch in create_minibatches(states, actions, log_probs_old, advantages, returns, batch_size):
                # Compute policy loss
                ratio = exp(log_probs_new - log_probs_old)
                clip_factor = clip(ratio, 1-epsilon, 1+epsilon)
                policy_loss = -min(ratio * advantages, clip_factor * advantages).mean()
                
                # Compute value loss
                value_loss = mse(value_network(states), returns)
                
                # Compute total loss
                total_loss = policy_loss + c1 * value_loss - c2 * entropy(policy_network)
                
                # Update networks
                optimize(total_loss)
        
        # Update old policy
        update_old_policy(policy_network)

# Main training loop
env = create_environment()
ppo = PPO(env, num_episodes=1000, num_epochs=10, batch_size=64)
ppo.train()
```

### Conclusion
